# Netflix is a service that offers a wide variety of TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on a variety of devices.

In 2018, they published a report that
 shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010, and the number of movies on the streaming service has dropped by more than 2,000 titles since 2010. It will be quite interesting to see what else can be gleaned from the same data set.

We had tasks such as:

To understand what content is popular in different countries. To find out if it is true that in recent years Netflix has been focusing more and more on television rather than movies?

In our research, we found that India has the biggest disparity, with movies dominating TV shows by about 8 times, but in the United States, TV shows are produced more than movies.

It has also been noticed that the highest number of Russian movies and TV shows on Netflix appeared in 2015, with 2019 in second place and 2017 in third place. Unfortunately, the number of Russian movies on Netflix is extremely small and it is impossible to observe the dynamics of the ratio of movies/TV shows.

Nevertheless, we can observe that for 7 years the largest number of Russian series on Netflix appeared in 2015. This may be due to the fact that:

Attitudes toward the TV series genre have basically changed for both the watchers and the creators. A TV series is not, of course, a new book or a new movie. But already Steven Soderbergh himself is behind the camera ("Knickerbocker Hospital"), and actors play their best roles (Matthew McConaughey in "True Detective," Claire Danes in "Homeland").

We can see that the spread between the number of TV shows and movies in the U.S. has been shrinking since 2017, so in 2020 there were 183 movies and 212 TV shows. That is, the number of TV shows has increased a lot, there has been a change in trend. This may be due to the fact that:

Series create a layer for social communication, a much-needed human discussion. A popular product of serial filmmaking has a multi-hour duration, which allows a whole discussion base to be created based on a particular moment or character.

From the above, we can conclude that there were 1.16 times fewer movies produced in 2020 than TV shows. In 2021, there is an average of 1.44 TV shows per movie, but judging by the trend, that number will increase.
